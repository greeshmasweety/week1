<p><i>Crescent Beaches
 

    Shaped like the new moon, Goa’s beaches are known the world over. Fringed by swaying palm and coconut trees with cool and comfortable shacks offering a variety of refreshments, Goa’s 103 km coastline is blessed with the most enchanting beaches lapped by the Arabian Sea. And almost all of them are swimmer friendly with the assured presence of lifeguards on all the popular beaches.
    
     
    
    Sun, Sand, Surf And The Sea
     
    
    105 kms of Konkan coast stretches across the state of Goa providing a wide range of choice in beaches to suit everybody’s needs. There are unspoilt pristine stretches of sand for the solitude seeker and there are those ones jammed with people in every square feet of sand.
    
     
    
    There are beaches far from human habitation with very basic or sometimes no facility for accommodation. Then there are some with ultra modern comforts like internet cafes, massage centers, gyms, swimming pools, night clubs, etc. With such an enormous choice, one might feel confused about which one to take.
    
     
    
    But on the contrary, it’s quite easy to plan an itinerary for getting suntan allover the body. Taking the capital Panaji and the next major city Margao as base points, all the beaches can be visited in a stretch. North from Panaji lies the most famous beach of Calangute.From here onwards to the northern tip of the state, swaying palms and shimmering sands stretch giving an enchanting sight.The further north, the emptier the beaches become.
    
     
    
    The same can be said about the silvery sands, which stretch down southwards from Margao. Right from Colva, the famous silvery white sand beach, there is an uninterrupted continuity in beaches. The more you move south the lonelier the beaches are.When it comes to beaches, the visitor is spoilt for choice.
    
    North Goa Circuit
     
    
    This stretch begins from the headland of Fort Aguada just outside Panaji city and moves up north towards the border to Maharashtra. Right from the Fort Aguada Beach Resort, an interrupted stretch of sand lies awaiting tourists, sunbathers and party animals.Sinquerim, Candolim, Calangute, Baga, Anjuna, Vagator, Morjim and Arambol are the beaches that can be covered in the North Goa Circuit.
    
     
    
    South Goa Circuit
     
    
    Another major base to begin the beach conquest is from Margao, the second most important city in Goa.Beginning from Majorda beach, a 20 kms long silvery white sand stretches across till the headland of Cabo de Rama.Velsao, Majorda, Betalbatim, Colva, Benaulim, Varca, Cavelossim, Mobor and Betul beaches are all interconnected.</p>
