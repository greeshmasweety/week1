<p>The JD(U) on Thursday added review of the Agnipath defence recruitment scheme to its list of expectations from the new NDA government, apart from four ministerial berths. The party may also push for its long-standing demand of special status for Bihar, now that it is set to be a part of the government at the Centre.

    Asked about the JD(U)’s remarks regarding Agnipath, another NDA ally, Chirag Paswan of the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), told NDTV in an interview: “Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) has said the platform is open for discussions. I believe that we must discuss how much we could deliver through Agniveer, because this is something related to the youths of our country. A review must be done. But these things can be kept on hold… Government formation is happening and, after that, we can discuss these things.”
    
    On Thursday, JD(U) supremo and BiharChief Minister Nitish Kumar held a series of meetings, including with his 12 newly elected MPs, at his residence on Kamraj Lane in Delhi. “There is anger among voters with regard to the Agnipath scheme. Our party wants that this scheme is discussed threadbare in the government to remove its flaws,” JD(U) national spokesperson K C Tyagi said after the meetings, while adding that the party’s support to the NDA was “unconditional”.
